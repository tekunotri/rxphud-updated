# HOW TO CHANGE SCOREBOARD
The hud includes 2 different scoreboards. Default scoreboard is 32 players (16v16) one but you can easily
swap to 6v6 scoreboard by renaming:

``C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\yourname\team fortress 2\tf/resource/ui/Scoreboard_6v6.res``
to ``Scoreboard.res``

# USEFUL INFO
 NOTE: This hud works only with **cl_hud_minmode 0**. Set it using console or using your autoexec.

*This hud should work with every screen resolution. I have tested it in 1680x1050.* -revan_xp

*(i tested in 1280x960 4:3 and 1280x720 16:9)* - techno

MVM isn't supported (although it should? work fine), this hud predates it by a year

some gamemodes might have overlapping things with health/ammo (pass time/pd_farmgageddon being such cases)
